    Computes the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on 2 samples.

    This is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that 2 independent samples
    are drawn from the same continuous distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    This tests whether 2 samples are drawn from the same distribution. Note
    that, like in the case of the one-sample K-S test, the distribution is
    assumed to be continuous.

    This is the two-sided test, one-sided tests are not implemented.
    The test uses the two-sided asymptotic Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.

    If the K-S statistic is small or the p-value is high, then we cannot
    reject the hypothesis that the distributions of the two samples
    are the same.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> np.random.seed(12345678)  #fix random seed to get the same result
    >>> n1 = 200  # size of first sample
    >>> n2 = 300  # size of second sample

    For a different distribution, we can reject the null hypothesis since the
    pvalue is below 1%:

    >>> rvs1 = stats.norm.rvs(size=n1, loc=0., scale=1)
    >>> rvs2 = stats.norm.rvs(size=n2, loc=0.5, scale=1.5)
    >>> stats.ks_2samp(rvs1, rvs2)
    (0.20833333333333337, 4.6674975515806989e-005)

    For a slightly different distribution, we cannot reject the null hypothesis
    at a 10% or lower alpha since the p-value at 0.144 is higher than 10%

    >>> rvs3 = stats.norm.rvs(size=n2, loc=0.01, scale=1.0)
    >>> stats.ks_2samp(rvs1, rvs3)
    (0.10333333333333333, 0.14498781825751686)

    For an identical distribution, we cannot reject the null hypothesis since
    the p-value is high, 41%:

    >>> rvs4 = stats.norm.rvs(size=n2, loc=0.0, scale=1.0)
    >>> stats.ks_2samp(rvs1, rvs4)
    (0.07999999999999996, 0.41126949729859719)
